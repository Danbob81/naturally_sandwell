This site is for like minded people who live in or around Sandwell, a part of *The Black Country* in the West Midlands, who love nature and wish to share their wildlife experiences with others in the local area. This site is designed to help fuel that passion by providing information to users about the wildlife that can be spotted near them and provide socialising opportunities with information about nature walks that they can join in with.
